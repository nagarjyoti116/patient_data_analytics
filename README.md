# ðŸ©º Patient Data Analyzer (Node.js & Express)

A Node.js and Express application that fetches paginated patient data from an external API, calculates risk scores based on temperature, age, and blood pressure, and returns useful analytics such as:
- High-risk patients
- Patients with fever
- Patients with data quality issues

This app includes retry logic, pagination handling, and defensive data validation to handle real-world API inconsistencies.
